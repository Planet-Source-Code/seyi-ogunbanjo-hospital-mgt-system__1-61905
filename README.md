## Hospital Mgt\. System


</div>

### Description

It "manages" patient records: You can add new records, (update or delete) existing records.

Restrictions are placed on some editing or viewing commands according to what you log -in as.
 
### More Info
 
The main input records are from a MS Access 97 database named allDB.mdb

This is not exactly the latest version, which I lost in a virus disaster. I hope to update this one soon enough though, but it gives an overview of the program's functionality.
